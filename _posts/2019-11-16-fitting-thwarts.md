After some time away, I cut the thwarts down to size. Unfortunately in doing so,
I measured once and cut twice, making one arm of the rear seat too short. I had
to cut away more and scarf in a new piece of wood, then refinish everything to
make it sit flush. It should be fine in the end, though.

The plans said to nail through the hull into the ends of the thwarts, and affix
with epoxy. This didn't seem like the ideal approach, particularly if the seats
were to ever be removed for repairs. Typically, seats are hung from the gunnels,
and thwarts are bolted directly to the gunnels.

I decided to epoxy a piece of wood to the hull, then bolt the seats to that.
This would give me much more surface area to adhere, and allow for the seats to
be removed should I need.

For the thwarts, I drilled through the gunnels, before realizing that there just
wasn't enough room there to attach the thwarts - the holes would be in the very
ends of the wood. I filled the holes back up with thickened epoxy, and attached
extensions to the gunnels so there would be room for a proper connection. Since
this section of wood was relatively short, and it would be supporting the yoke
(and therefore the weight of the canoe), I decided to nail it in as well.
Luckily I had exactly 4 boat nails left.

I didn't want the bolts sticking up above the gunnel, since I'll be sliding this
canoe onto roof racks, so I countersunk the holes.

Meanwhile, I began the tedious work of fairing the inside of the hull. I really
should've used peel ply for the taped seams. First I sanded the entire inside of
the canoe, then filled in all the low spots with epoxy thickened with a fairing
compound as best I could.

Here it is at that stage, with the thwarts and seats in their final positions.

This wasn't nearly enough fairing, so I ended up sanding the entire inside of
the canoe again, and again spreading fairing compound over basically the whole
thing. After sanding the inside a third time, it needed touch ups only in
spots - I did maybe two rounds of that.

Finally, I spread on a thin layer of epoxy to harden the surface of the wood and
to function as a sealer and primer before painting.
