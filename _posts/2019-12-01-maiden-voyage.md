The maiden voyage of my canoe was on the Rainbow and Withlacoochee rivers in
central Florida. Drove 5 hours with it on the roof of the car, which was a bit
nerve wracking, but uneventful.

It looks at home among the palmettos.

Trying it out. It floats! (the idea of there being a hole in this thing that I
haven't seen by now is pretty absurd, considering the amount of time I've spent
with each square inch)

My brother took my mom for a spin

And my favorite photo comes courtesy of my brother. This is me lowering it off
my shoulders into the water for the first time.
