I've been interested in trying my hand at knifemaking for a while. This was my
first crack at it.

Many knifemakers use a large suite of tools - bench grinders, bandsaws,
table-top belt sanders. I wasn't about to invest in all that stuff, so I decided
to do it with just an angle grinder. I did make a mount so I can bolt my angle
grinder to a flat surface.

Grabbed some parts from the hardware store

The holes on the angle brackets weren't quite big enough, so I enlarged them
with my dremel.

I got a bar of 1095 steel on the internet, and hacked away at it with the angle
grinder until I got this.

I made a makeshift forge by lining a soup can with refractory cement - stuck a
propane torch in there and heat-treated the blade.

I don't have any pictures of this process, but for the handle I took a scrap of
walnut, drilled a couple holes in the end to stick the blade, then shaped it
like this with a chisel and some sandpaper.

The blade is epoxied in the handle, which I finished with boiled linseed oil.  I then sharpened and polished the blade with progressive sanding.
